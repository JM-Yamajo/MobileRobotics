# Mobile Robot Path Planning Simulations

This project aims to provide foundational examples of mobile robot path planning and control techniques. It includes simple implementations and simulations suitable for educational purposes and initial prototyping.

## Contents

The repository includes the following simulations:

- **Trajectory Parametrization:** Methods to parametrize robot trajectories for smooth and efficient movement.
- **Simple LIDAR Usage:** Basic examples of using LIDAR for obstacle detection and environment mapping.
- **Coordinate Mapping:** Techniques to map and transform coordinates for accurate robot positioning and navigation.
- **PID Controller Design:** Implementation of PID controllers for precise position control of mobile robots.

## Requirements

To run the simulations, you need the following:

- MATLAB (version 2019b or later recommended)
- Robotics System Toolbox

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JM-Yamajo/MobileRobotics.git
    ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
3. Run the desired script:
    ```matlab
    run('trajectory_parametrization.m')
    ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and visualize the simulation results.
